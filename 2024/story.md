# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 🎄

The **Chief Historian** is always present for the big Christmas sleigh launch, but nobody has seen him in **months**! ⏳ Last anyone heard, he was visiting locations that are historically significant to the North Pole.

A group of **Senior Historians** has asked you to accompany them as they check the places they think he was most likely to visit.

As each location is checked, they will mark it on their list with a **star**. 🌟 They figure the Chief Historian must be in one of the first **fifty** places they'll look. So, in order to save Christmas, you need to help them get **fifty stars** on their list before **Santa** takes off on **December 25th**.

## **Your Mission:**

- Collect stars by solving puzzles. 🧩
- Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar. 📅
- The second puzzle unlocks once you complete the first. 🔓
- Each puzzle grants one star! 🌟

**Good luck!** You'll need to stay sharp to save Christmas! 🎅🎄
