# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code puzzles, a series of daily coding challenges released every December.

## Description

Advent of Code is an annual event where participants solve puzzles related to programming and problem-solving. As a beginner, these solutions represent my attempts at solving the puzzles.

## Structure

The solutions are organized by year and day. Each day's folder contains code files for both parts of the puzzle.

- **Year**
    - **Day**
        - `input`
        - `main.cpp`
        - `task.md`

## Language Used

- **2023**: C++

## Usage

Feel free to explore these solutions for reference or learning purposes. As a beginner, these solutions might not be optimal and could be improved. Each solution includes comments explaining the approach and logic used.

## Disclaimer

I'm a beginner, and these solutions might not be perfect or the most elegant. They represent my learning journey through the challenges.
